# Introduction

The mission of MoDeL is to provide a set of front-end related tools to modernize the business-set web applications. Its priority is to use tools which are more future-proof and robust to ensure medium- to long-term compatibility to the web platform as a whole, to provide a default web-native tooling set which is also compatible with other frameworks.
