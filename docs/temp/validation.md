# Validation Ideas

- Inline errors shall be used for form validation via native browser APIs. This means that the detailed error messages are showed in layers e.g as tooltip.

- Absence of data in lists e.g DataGrid, List, etc. is not a validation error.
    - To amplify that the data is missing, inline design is needed e.g. an "missing" Icon with a Text "No results found"
