# Versioning

The recommended schema used in MoDeL applications is the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

It enables the developers to utilize tools such as [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version), which is enabled by default in the [**sample-client**](https://github.com/3mo-esolutions/sample-client) repository.
