### Usage
- Use dialogs when a user action is necessary, e.g a dialog with a heading of "Barcode missing", that scans the barcode before the process can be proceed.
- In forms, inline error validations shall be used. Snackbar could support with a message summarizing the input validation, such as "Inputs were invalid", "The data could not be processed" and "Network error".
- In cases where the message has too much of significance, dialogs with [acknowledgement actions](https://material.io/components/dialogs#actions) shall be used.

### Design
- As designed in the [Material Dark Theme Guidelines](https://material.io/design/color/dark-theme.html#custom-application) the background and foreground colors has been overwritten in the dark mode.
